# Treza Labs

Treza Labs builds systems that enable computation to remain private, verifiable, and secure. Our infrastructure uses secure enclaves and zero knowledge proofs to protect sensitive data while proving the integrity of code execution. With Treza, you can deploy your applications in hardware-protected enclaves with cryptographic privacy guarantees. Run containers, APIs, KYC and AI workloads with simple, privacy-focused developer tools.
