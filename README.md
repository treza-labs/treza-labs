# Treza Labs

**Privacy infrastructure for crypto and finance.**

Treza Labs builds systems that enable computation to remain private, verifiable, and secure. Our infrastructure uses secure enclaves to protect sensitive data while proving the integrity of code execution — a foundation for trusted AI and financial systems.

> Privacy only works if we do.
